                    <p>You are the only you there ever has been or ever will be. You are unique in all the universe.
                        Just
                        the odds of you being here at this exact place and this exact time are so great and so rare that
                        it
                        will never happen again.

                        Written by the New York Times best-selling author of What Do You Do With an Idea?, this is a
                        story
                        for everything you will do and everything you can be—for who you are right now and all the
                        magical,
                        unbounded potential you hold inside. With rich, enchanting illustrations, it’s a reminder that
                        you
                        were meant for incredible things. And maybe, just maybe, you will exceed your wildest dreams.
