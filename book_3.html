                    <p>Meet Miss Charlotte… a modern Mary Poppins who wears a large hat and a crumpled dress that maker
                        her look like a scarecrow, and she talks to a rock!

                        Mademoiselle Charlotte, the new teacher, is not like the others: she wears a large hat and a
                        crumpled dress that make her look like a scarecrow, and she talks to a rock. The children think
                        she is crazy at first, but soon realize she makes school more fun than ever, getting them to
                        measure the room with cooked spaghetti in maths class, telling fascinating stories about a
                        gorilla and even taking the pupils on at football.

                        The first book in Dominique Demers’s popular Adventure of Miss Charlotte series, The New
                        Teacher, brilliantly illustrated by Tony Ross, is an entertaining, imaginative and inspiring
                        book that will make you wish you had a teacher just like Mademoiselle Charlotte</p>
