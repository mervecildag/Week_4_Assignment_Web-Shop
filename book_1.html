                    <p>The five time bestseller of the year that has transformed the lives of millions around the world.
                        In
                        a small
                        cafe at a location so remote it stands in the middle of the middle of nowhere, John--a man in a
                        hurry--is at
                        a crossroads. Intent only on refueling before moving along on his road trip, he finds sustenance
                        of
                        an
                        entirely different kind. In addition to the specials of the day, the cafe menu lists three
                        questions
                        all
                        diners are encouraged to consider: Why are you here? Do you fear death? Are you fulfilled? With
                        this
                        food
                        for thought and the guidance of three people he meets at the cafe, John embarks on a journey of
                        self-discovery. Along the way he discovers a new way to look at life, himself, and just how much
                        you
                        can
                        learn from a green sea turtle.</p>
